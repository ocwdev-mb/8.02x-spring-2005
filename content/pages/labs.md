Each partnership of two students will build and use 9 experiments. All experiments need to be demonstrated and checked off during lab hours. Experiment related questions will be included on the problem sets in the {{% resource_link 25e4986e-5dc6-a36f-5ec2-32573b2d001b "assignments" %}} section, as well as in each of the 4 quizzes in the {{% resource_link c62bf1ba-c93a-1174-a4ef-d24a2de4113d "exams" %}} section. Early check-off of the experiments will be awarded bonus points.

Complete instructions and questions for the experiments can be found in the experiment manual.Â All necessary materials can be acquired from an online electronics supply source.
